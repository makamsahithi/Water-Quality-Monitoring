# Water-Quality-Monitoring
The major goal of the project is to use machine learning techniques to measure water
quality. A potability is a numerical phrase that is used to assess the quality of a body of water.
The following water quality parameters were utilised to assess the overall water quality in
terms of potability in this study. TDS (Total Dissolved Solvents), turbidity, pH, conductivity,
temperature and labels were the parameters. To depict the water quality, these parameters are
used as a feature vector. To estimate the water quality class, the project used these types of
classification algorithms: Random Forest, LSTM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM,
KNN, Gradient Boost. These algorithms will be compared using accuracy, precision, recall,
F1 scores. Experiments were carried out utilising a real dataset containing information from
various locations, as well as a synthetic dataset generated at random using parameters. Based
on the results of these different types of classifiers, it was discovered that the Random Forest
Classifier outperforms other classifiers.
